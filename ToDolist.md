Basic Git Commands ( Which we are going to do continuously )
1) git clone             ( to download the entire repository )
2) git pull              ( to download just the changes that your don't have)
3) git commit -m "msg"   ( before you push anything, make sure you tell what you're doing in the comming msg ) 
4) git push              ( Publishes the changed to your repo )


So, how to authenticate to our GitHub account from our computer ?

1) On your GitHub account, generate a PAT ( Personal Access Token )
2) Now save that on a notePad, on your VSCode, run the "git push" couple of times and you'd see the prompt to enter the token
3) That's it and it's an one time effort and from now you can publish the code to your repo n number of times.
